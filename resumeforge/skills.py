"""Occupation-neutral, evidence-backed Skills selection.

Job priorities are useful, but a resume Skills row should be based on:
  1. what the applicant actually lists or demonstrably uses,
  2. what the complete posting asks for (not just its first model keywords),
  3. what the final printable accomplishments demonstrate, and
  4. the finite amount of space left on the actual page.

New technical labels may be promoted from positively attributed achievements,
never from a job posting or an unselected example alone. No job-specific
whitelists or mandatory vendors are required.
