For each bullet, identify the task the target employer wants performed with the priority, then describe performing that task.
Use the past role only to choose a plausible setting. A sentence about another use of the same tool misses the assignment.
Avoid generic phrases such as 'tracked outcomes for KEYWORD', 'pilot for KEYWORD' and
'quality checks for KEYWORD'. Integrate each capability naturally into a specific
technical action and name the system, review, artifact, or decision involved.
Do not substitute a related but different task, tool, credential, or outcome merely because its wording overlaps the requirement.
Connect the work to a visible artifact or decision and a measurable outcome. Prefer concrete counts and times to sweeping claims about quality or compliance.
Given two target tools with similar names, use the actual capability requested. Spread different achievements across slots.
For each numbered slot, write one concise bullet (15–30 words) and one detailed version (30–55 words) about the same accomplishment, with consistent metrics.
